# Codebase Audit & Fix Tracker

**Audit date:** 2026-10-17
**Scope:** all of `src/` (~5k lines), `prisma/schema.prisma` + migration, `tests/`, config. At audit time: build ✅, lint ✅, 8/8 tests ✅, `npm audit`: 10 vulns (1 critical, 6 high, 3 moderate).

**Summary:** The architecture is sound (transactional outbox/inbox, leased claims, Docker sandbox, approval gates, draft-only PRs). The execution pipeline was not production-safe: most failure paths left executions stuck forever or hot-looping, and the publish step trusted a workspace that LLM-written code could tamper with.

## How to use this file

## Fix log

### Pass 1 — 2026-10-17: all Critical + High (uncommitted, working tree on `main`)

**Verification performed**
- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`: clean.
- `npm test`: 22/22, including 14 new regression tests in `tests/auditFixes.test.js` (code writer, secret patterns, log redaction, validation, auth, consumer retry/DLQ).
- Generated Docker/git shell scripts pass `sh -n`. The publish flow (intent-to-add diff → fresh clone → `git apply --index` → commit → force push, run twice) was simulated against a local bare repo: new files applied, planted `pre-commit`/`pre-push` hooks did **not** run, no token in `.git/config`, the re-run was idempotent.
- The new migration matches `prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema` output.

**Not verified end-to-end** (no Docker daemon or GitHub App in this environment): real Docker execution, GitHub push and PR creation, RabbitMQ retry/dead-letter queues against a live broker, the lease heartbeat and recovery sweep against a live DB. Run one Trello → PR execution locally before relying on it.

**Breaking changes / action required**
1. **Run the migration:** `npm run prisma:migrate:local` (adds `Execution.leaseUntil` + index; migration `20261017000000_execution_lease`).
2. **Approvals now require `snapshotHash`:** `POST /api/executions/:id/approvals/:type` body must include `snapshotHash` (64-char hex) taken from the pending approval in `GET /api/executions/:id`. Frontend/clients must send it.
3. **Auth fails closed:** without `API_AUTH_TOKEN`, `/api/*` returns 401 unless `AUTH_DISABLED=true` (refused when `NODE_ENV=production`). `AUTH_DISABLED=true` was added to your `.env.local`.
4. **CORS fails closed:** an empty `CORS_ORIGINS` now blocks all browser origins (non-browser clients without `Origin` still work).
5. **New env vars** (all optional, defaults shown in `.env.example`): `AUTH_DISABLED`, `EXECUTION_LEASE_MS`, `CONSUMER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `CONSUMER_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`.
6. **New RabbitMQ queues** are declared automatically per consumer: `<queue>.retry` (TTL → back to the queue) and `<queue>.dead`. Inspect `*.dead` for messages that exhausted retries.
7. `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` defaults to 16000; lower it for models with a smaller output cap (the provider will return a 400 otherwise).

**Files changed:** `src/utils/safeError.ts` (new), `src/services/llm/errors.ts` (new), `src/utils/codeWriter.ts`, `src/services/workspaceService.ts`, `src/services/executionWorker.ts`, `src/services/agentGraph/executionGraph.ts`, `src/services/agentGraph/diffReview.ts`, `src/services/rabbitMQService.ts`, `src/services/outboxService.ts`, `src/services/trelloPollingService.ts`, `src/services/executionService.ts`, `src/integrations/githubApp.ts`, `src/middleware/authenticate.ts`, `src/middleware/validate.ts`, `src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`, `src/controllers/executionController.ts`, `src/controllers/taskController.ts`, `src/routes/executionRoutes.ts`, `src/services/llm/providers/*.ts`, `src/services/agentRunner.ts`, `src/services/messagingService.ts`, `src/services/taskQueueService.ts`, `src/config.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/20261017000000_execution_lease/`, `.env.example`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tests/auditFixes.test.js` (new).

**Follow-ups discovered during the fix pass** (tracked below as new items): F1–F4.

### Pass 2 — 2026-10-17: repo hygiene (X6), branch `chore/repo-hygiene`

- All previously uncommitted work (pre-existing changes + pass 1 fixes) committed in logical chunks; each commit was type-checked on its own (see the commit list in `git log main..chore/repo-hygiene`).
- Docs reorganized under `docs/` (moved, not deleted); tool folders and `scratch/` ignored; personal roadmap excluded locally.
- Not merged or pushed: review the branch, then merge into `main`.

### Pass 4 — 2026-10-19: benchmark prerequisites (M2, M3, M5, M7)

Fixed before Phase 0 of `docs/plans/AGENTIC_ROADMAP.md`, because each would skew the coding benchmark.
- **M2:** every retry starts from a clean checkout (`resetWorkspace`: `git reset --hard` + `git clean -fd -e node_modules`).
- **M3:** policy violations are a failed attempt with feedback (`agentGraph/repoPolicy.ts`), routed to `analyze_failure`, or `BLOCKED` on the last attempt.
- **M5:** dotfiles (e.g. `.env`) no longer reach the repo context sent to the LLM; `.env.example` still does.
- **M7:** the verification workspace is deleted when the run step ends (`KEEP_WORKSPACES=true` keeps it); on Linux, root-owned files are deleted from inside a container.
- Build ✅ · lint ✅ · **36/36 tests ✅** (3 new in `tests/agentGraphHelpers.test.js`; the M5 test fails on the old code).

### Pass 3 — 2026-10-17: tracker adapter refactor (A1), branch `chore/repo-hygiene`

- Issue-tracker access goes through an `IssueTrackerAdapter` registry; Trello is the only adapter (no Jira support added).
- Build ✅ · lint ✅ · **28/28 tests ✅** (6 new in `tests/trackerAdapters.test.js`).
- Behaviour change: syncing a non-tracker integration (e.g. `GITHUB`) returns 400 instead of calling the Trello API.
- Not verified against the live Trello API in this environment; the HTTP calls themselves are unchanged from before the refactor.

## Critical

### - [x] C1 — LLM-written code can steal the GitHub token via git hooks
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1 (uncommitted)
**Where:** `src/services/workspaceService.ts`, `src/services/executionWorker.ts` (`publish`), `src/utils/codeWriter.ts`
**Problem:** Verification ran LLM-written code with `.git` writable; `commitAndPush` then ran `git commit`/`push` with network and token in that same workspace, so planted hooks ran with credentials and were invisible in the reviewed diff.
**Fix:**
- [x] New `publishApprovedDiff()`: publishes from a **fresh clone** at the recorded base SHA and applies only the approved diff bytes (`git apply --index`). The verification workspace is never committed or pushed. The old `commitAndPush` was removed.
- [x] The approved diff is read from the stored artifact and its hash re-checked against the approval before publishing.
- [x] All git invocations use `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null -c core.fsmonitor=false`; commit/push also use `--no-verify`; diffs use `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv`.
- [x] `codeWriter` rejects any path with a `.git` segment (case-insensitive).

### - [x] C2 — Any graph failure leaves the execution stuck in `RUNNING` forever
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Where:** `src/services/executionWorker.ts`, `src/services/agentGraph/executionGraph.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`
**Fix:**
- [x] New `markExecutionFailed()` moves any non-terminal execution to `FAILED` with `lastError`, an `EXECUTION_FAILED` event and a Trello comment. It's wired as the `onExhausted` hook of all three execution consumers (plan/run/publish).
- [x] Added `Execution.leaseUntil` (+ migration). `run()` atomically claims `QUEUED` executions (or `RUNNING`/`VERIFYING` ones with an expired lease), renews the lease every `EXECUTION_LEASE_MS/3` while the graph runs, and on error releases back to `QUEUED` for a bounded retry.
- [x] `recoverStalledExecutions()` sweep (every 60s) requeues runs whose lease expired (worker crash) via the outbox.
- [x] `plan()` resumes from `PLANNING`, so a failure after the status change no longer strands it.
- [x] Trello is notified on `FAILED`.
- [x] Attempt numbers continue across retried runs (`attemptOffset`), avoiding a `TaskAttempt(planTaskId, number)` unique violation on retry.

### - [x] C3 — Failed messages hot-loop forever
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Where:** `src/services/rabbitMQService.ts`
**Fix:**
- [x] Failures go to `<queue>.retry` (TTL `CONSUMER_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, dead-lettered back to the queue) with an `x-attempt` header, up to `CONSUMER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`; then to `<queue>.dead` plus the `onExhausted` hook. No more `nack(requeue=true)`.
- [x] `NonRetryableError` (snapshot mismatch, base branch moved, policy violation, bad message, wrong status) skips retries.
- [x] Malformed JSON is dead-lettered instead of dropped.
- [x] The consumer callback can no longer reject (e.g. ack on a closed channel); unacked messages are redelivered after reconnect.
- [x] The workspace is wiped before each clone, so partial clones can't wedge retries.

### - [x] C4 — A brief DB outage crashes the process
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Where:** `src/services/outboxService.ts`, `src/services/trelloPollingService.ts` (now `integrationPollingService.ts`, see A1)
**Fix:**
- [x] Interval ticks are wrapped in try/catch with safe logging.
- [x] Overlap guards (`flushing` / `syncing` flags) skip a tick while the previous one is still running.

---

## High

### - [x] H1 — Auth disabled by default
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] Auth is skipped only with an explicit `AUTH_DISABLED=true`; startup refuses it in production. A missing token otherwise returns 401 with a clear message.
- [x] An empty `CORS_ORIGINS` now denies all browser origins.

### - [x] H2 — `validate()` discards parsed output (mass assignment, missing defaults)
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] Parsed `body`/`params`/`query` are written back to `req` (unknown keys stripped, defaults applied).
- [x] `createRepository` and `createIntegration` pick fields explicitly.

### - [x] H3 — Code writer silently drops files containing backticks
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] New line-based `parseFileActions()`: content may contain backticks; handles CRLF; a block ends at a line that is exactly a closing fence.
- [x] A `FILE:` header without an opening or closing fence throws.
- [x] All blocks are parsed before any write (no partial output). Tests added.
- Note: a markdown file whose content contains a bare ```` ``` ```` line will still end the block early. A structured JSON `files[]` contract would remove this edge case.

### - [x] H4 — Anthropic output truncated; no provider detects truncation
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (default 16000) is used by Anthropic (`max_tokens`) and Gemini (`maxOutputTokens`).
- [x] New `LLMOutputError` thrown on Anthropic `stop_reason` `max_tokens`/`refusal`, OpenAI `finish_reason` `length`/`content_filter`, Gemini `MAX_TOKENS`/other non-STOP reasons/`blockReason`, and on empty output. Anthropic and Gemini join all text parts.

### - [x] H5 — GitHub token exposure
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] Git authenticates with `-c http.extraHeader="Authorization: Basic …"` computed inside the container from `$GITHUB_TOKEN`; clone URLs carry no credentials, so nothing is written to `.git/config`.
- [x] Docker gets `-e GITHUB_TOKEN` (name only); the value comes from the child process env, so it's not on the argv. Verification containers get no token at all.
- [x] `SECRET_PATTERNS` now cover `gh[pousr]_`, `github_pat_`, `sk-…` (incl. `sk-ant-`, `sk-proj-`), AWS `AKIA…`, Google `AIza…`, Slack `xox?-`, and credentials embedded in URLs.
- Residual: the token is still visible via `docker inspect` while the short-lived `--rm` container runs (see F2).

### - [x] H6 — Secrets leak into logs
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] New `describeError()` logs only method, URL without query string, status and message, never axios config or headers. Used in rabbitMQService, executionWorker, outbox, Trello polling, messagingService, taskQueueService, agentRunner, taskController, errorHandler. Trello `lastError` is stored via it as well.
- [x] Gemini key moved to the `x-goog-api-key` header (list + generate); the model name is URL-encoded.

### - [x] H7 — Concurrent approvals trigger duplicate runs
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] Approval and execution are updated with `updateMany` guarded by `status: PENDING` / `status: transition.from`; if either count ≠ 1 the transaction throws 409 and rolls back.

### - [x] H8 — Approval not bound to what the reviewer saw
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] The approve body requires `snapshotHash`; a mismatch with the pending approval returns 409. **Breaking change for clients.**

### - [x] H9 — Symlink escape from workspace on the host
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] The root is `realpath`'d; every existing path segment from root to target is `lstat`'d and any symlink is rejected. Tested with a junction pointing outside the root.
- Residual: a TOCTOU window between check and write remains if something else mutates the workspace concurrently (nothing does during `implement_change`). Moving writes into the container would close it fully.

### - [x] H10 — Vulnerable dependencies
**Status:** DONE (production) · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Fix:**
- [x] `npm audit fix` applied: **0 production vulnerabilities** (`npm audit --omit=dev`).
- Remaining: 11 high in dev-only tooling (`@typescript-eslint/*` v7 → `minimatch`/`braces`). Fixing needs a breaking upgrade to typescript-eslint v8 + ESLint 9 flat config (see F4).

## Follow-ups found during fix pass 1

- [ ] **F1. Recovery sweep has no attempt cap.** An execution that crashes the process every run would be requeued by `recoverStalledExecutions` indefinitely. Count lease expiries (e.g. an `Execution.runAttempts` column) and fail after N.
- [ ] **F2. Token visible via `docker inspect` during clone/publish.** Pass it via a 0600 temp file mounted read-only (or Docker secrets) instead of env.
- [ ] **F3. End-to-end verification.** Run a real Trello → plan → approve (with `snapshotHash`) → run → publish cycle with Docker + the GitHub App, including forced failures (kill the worker mid-run, revoke the token) to exercise retry, dead-letter, `FAILED` and lease recovery.
  - *Progress (2026-10-18):* automated harness added (`npm run test:e2e`, `tests/e2e/`, `.env.e2e.example`). Against real Trello, GitHub and Gemini (`gemini-flash-lite-latest`), **all three suites pass**. The full happy path ran end to end: Trello card → plan → approvals → Docker run → verified diff → **draft PR #1** on `zack10/agent-orchestration-test` (only the expected one-line README change) → Trello comment. The `gemini-flash-latest` free tier (20 requests/day) ran out during debugging. Remaining for F3: forced-failure scenarios (worker killed mid-run, revoked token) are not automated yet.
  - Bugs found by the e2e runs and fixed:
    - **Unfenced model output crashed the run.** The model was shown repo files as unfenced `FILE:` blocks and copied that format; the parser then threw out of the graph, so the queue re-ran the whole execution and left attempts stuck `RUNNING`. Now repo context uses a different delimiter, the prompt spells out the block format, and a malformed reply becomes a `FAILED` attempt (reply tail saved) that the model retries with the parse error as feedback (`executionGraph.ts`, `repoContext.ts`).
    - **Spurious mode change in every diff on Windows.** Bind mounts made every file host-written show as `100644 → 100755`, so diff review blocked every attempt. Workspace git commands now use `core.fileMode=false` (`workspaceService.ts`).
    - **Docker failures gave no reason.** The stored error was only the command line. It now includes exit code/signal and the stderr and stdout tails, with the token masked; verification failure output now includes stdout, where npm prints test failures.
    - **One rate-limited LLM call failed the whole run.** Retries now cover 429/503/529 responses, honouring `Retry-After` or Gemini's `retryDelay` (up to `LLM_RATE_LIMIT_RETRIES`, 60s cap). Exhausted credits or a quota that resets later than the cap fail fast as `NonRetryableError` (`services/llm/retry.ts`).
- [ ] **F4. Dev-tooling vulnerabilities.** Upgrade to `typescript-eslint` v8 and ESLint 9 (flat config).

---

## Medium

### - [ ] M1 — Publish is not idempotent
**Status:** PARTIAL · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Where:** `src/services/executionWorker.ts` (`publish`)
**Problem:** Push succeeds but PR creation fails → retry breaks on the existing branch. PR created but the DB update fails → duplicate PR.
**Done in pass 1:** force-push to the execution-owned branch from a fresh clone (retry-safe); an existing open PR for the branch is reused (`findOpenPullRequest`); an existing `PULL_REQUEST` artifact short-circuits to completion.
**Remaining:**
- [ ] Handle a PR that was closed/merged between retries; record publish sub-steps explicitly.

### - [x] M2 — Retries build on dirty workspace
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 4
**Where:** `src/services/agentGraph/executionGraph.ts` (analyze_failure → implement_change edge)
**Problem:** Failed attempts' edits persist into the next attempt; the writer can't delete files. (Whole-run retries now re-clone; the in-graph retry loop still doesn't reset.)
**Fix:**
- [x] `git reset --hard && git clean -fd` (excluding `node_modules`) before each retry in `implement_change`.

### - [x] M3 — Policy violations crash instead of retrying
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 1, pass 4
**Where:** `src/services/agentGraph/executionGraph.ts` (`enforceRepositoryPolicy`)
**Done in pass 1:** violations now throw `NonRetryableError`, so the execution fails fast to `FAILED` with the reason instead of hanging (C2).
**Remaining:**
- [x] Return `{ lastFailure, route }` and route to `analyze_failure`/`block_execution` so the agent gets a chance to fix the violation.

### - [ ] M4 — Every Trello list move or edit spawns a new execution
**Status:** TODO · **Fix ref:** —
**Where:** `src/integrations/trelloAdapter.ts`
**Fix:**
- [ ] Hash only `name` + `desc`; skip creating an execution if a non-terminal one exists for the work item.

### - [x] M5 — repoContext dotfile skip uses `&&` instead of `||`
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 4
**Where:** `src/services/agentGraph/repoContext.ts:33`
**Fix:**
- [x] Change to `||`; add a test.

### - [ ] M6 — Long runs exceed RabbitMQ consumer timeout
**Status:** TODO · **Fix ref:** —
**Where:** `executionWorker.run`, `rabbitMQService` (single shared channel)
**Problem:** Default `consumer_timeout` is 30 min; a long run can exceed it, and the broker then closes the shared channel. (With the lease from C2, a redelivered run now waits for lease expiry instead of being lost.)
**Fix:**
- [ ] Ack after claiming (the run is then driven by DB lease state), or raise the timeout per queue; use a channel per consumer.

### - [x] M7 — Workspaces never cleaned up
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 4
**Where:** `src/services/workspaceService.ts` (`removeWorkspace` used only before clone and for publish workspaces)
**Fix:**
- [x] Remove the verification workspace when the run step ends. Instead of `--user` (which breaks `npm ci` as a non-root user without a writable `HOME`), root-owned files are deleted from inside a container when the host can't.

### - [ ] M8 — Outbox has no row locking
**Status:** TODO · **Fix ref:** —
**Where:** `src/services/outboxService.ts`
**Fix:**
- [ ] Claim rows with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (or a `claimedBy`/`claimedUntil` update).

### - [ ] M9 — Inbox dedup is check-then-act
**Status:** PARTIAL · **Fix ref:** pass 1
**Where:** `src/services/executionWorker.ts` (`consumeOnce`)
**Done in pass 1:** messages are validated with Zod; all three handlers are status-guarded or claim-guarded, so a re-run is a no-op.
**Remaining:**
- [ ] Insert the receipt in the same transaction as the handler's state transition.

### - [ ] M10 — Execution budget not enforced
**Status:** TODO · **Fix ref:** —
**Where:** `src/services/executionService.ts` (`budget`), `src/services/agentGraph/executionGraph.ts` (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`)
**Fix:**
- [ ] Read the budget in the graph; track token usage; enforce the duration.

### - [ ] M11 — Implementation agent chosen arbitrarily
**Status:** TODO · **Fix ref:** —
**Where:** `src/services/agentGraph/executionGraph.ts` (`project.agents[0]`)
**Fix:**
- [ ] Select by explicit role/flag; error if ambiguous.

### - [ ] M12 — No LLM retry/backoff; approvals have no real actor
**Status:** PARTIAL · **Fix ref:** `src/services/llm/retry.ts`
**Where:** `src/services/llm/*`, `src/controllers/executionController.ts`
**Note:** whole-run retries (C3) now absorb transient 429s at a coarse level.
**Fix:**
- [x] Exponential backoff on 429/503/529 in `LLMService` (honours `Retry-After`, fails fast on exhausted credits or long quota waits). Timeouts are not retried.
- [ ] Per-user tokens or an actor bound to the token; record the real approver.

---

## Low

- [ ] **L1. HTTP connector SSRF gaps.** DNS rebinding TOCTOU; `isPrivateIp` misses `::ffff:x.x.x.x`, `100.64/10`, `198.18/15`; a body is sent on GET. `src/services/connectors/httpConnector.ts`. **Fix:** pin the resolved IP via a custom `lookup`, extend the ranges, drop `data` for GET.
- [ ] **L2. MCP returns fake success for unknown connector types.** `src/services/mcpService.ts`. **Fix:** throw.
- [ ] **L3. Idempotency races.** `createExecution` and `createTask` look first, then insert. **Fix:** catch P2002 and return the existing row.
- [ ] **L4. Task recovery sweep defeats the retry delay.** `taskQueueService.ts`. **Fix:** set `queuedAt` when scheduling a retry.
- [ ] **L5. `updateAgent` wipes the stored API key** when the config omits `apiKey`. **Fix:** merge with the existing config.
- [ ] **L6. Deleting an agent with tasks returns 400 "Related record not found".** **Fix:** map P2003 to 409.
- [ ] **L7. Unbounded list endpoints** (`getTasks`, `getProjects`, `getAgents`). **Fix:** pagination.
- [ ] **L8. Rate limiter keys on `req.ip` without `trust proxy`;** per-process. **Fix:** configure `trust proxy`; Redis limiter for multi-instance.
- [ ] **L9. No retention for `OutboxEvent`/`InboxReceipt`/`ExecutionEvent`.** **Fix:** cleanup job.
- [x] **L10. `artifacts/` is not gitignored.** WONTFIX (not a bug): `artifacts/` was already in the modified `.gitignore`; the audit check ran before the directory existed, so a directory-only pattern didn't match.

---

## Cleanup, docs & tests

- [ ] **X1. Remove or wire up dead code:** `sendMessage`, `executeMcpAction`, `claimWorkItemLock`, `releaseWorkItemLock`, `transitionWorkItemStatus`, `constants/routing.ts`, `hashFile`; message recovery has no producer/consumer; unused models `ToolCall`, `ApiContract`, `WorkItem.status`/`lock*`.
- [ ] **X2. Decide the future of the legacy Task pipeline** vs the Execution pipeline.
- [x] **X3. Docs.** DONE: `.env.example` RabbitMQ port fixed (15673) and new vars documented. README corrected (skills/MCP resources are *not* in prompts) and now documents fail-closed auth/CORS, `AUTH_DISABLED`, the approval `snapshotHash` body, `.retry`/`.dead` queues and the `FAILED` lifecycle, sandbox/publish guarantees, `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, single-test runs, the `db push` → migrations baseline, and the `docs/` layout. CLAUDE.md updated with the same rules.
- [ ] **X4. Integration tests** against docker-compose Postgres + RabbitMQ: execution happy path, approval races (H7), handler failures → `FAILED` (C2), retry cap/DLQ against a live broker (C3), lease recovery, outbox/inbox dedup, HTTP routes incl. auth/validation.
- [ ] **X5. Unit tests.** PARTIAL: added codeWriter (backticks, CRLF, `.git/`, symlinks, malformed), secret patterns, `describeError`, `validate`, auth, consumer retry/DLQ. Remaining: repoContext dotfiles (M5), provider truncation handling (H4), `decideApproval` guards (needs a DB).
- [x] **X6. Repo hygiene.** DONE (pass 2, branch `chore/repo-hygiene`):
  - [x] Pending work committed on a branch in logical chunks (see Fix log, pass 2).
  - [x] All planning/reference docs moved (none deleted) into `docs/plans`, `docs/specs`, `docs/testing`, `docs/guides`, `docs/history`. Extensionless notes got `.md` names. Tracked files were moved with `git mv` so history is kept.
  - [x] Tool state ignored: `.copilot/` and `.cline/` added (`.aider*`, `.junie/`, `.obsidian/`, `copilot/`, `opencode.json` were already ignored).
  - [x] `scratch/` untracked and ignored; the files remain on disk.
  - [x] `applied_ai_engineer_6_month_roadmap.md` (personal notes) kept in place, excluded locally via `.git/info/exclude`, not committed.

## Architecture

### - [x] A1 — Issue-tracker integration is hard-wired to Trello
**Status:** DONE · **Fix ref:** pass 3 (uncommitted, branch `chore/repo-hygiene`)
**Problem:** The data model was tracker-neutral (`WorkItem`, `IntegrationConnection`, `ExternalSystem` already lists `JIRA`), but every code path called Trello directly: the poller only queried `TRELLO` connections, `POST /integrations/:id/sync` called the Trello sync for any connection type, worker notifications were Trello-only, and the Trello adapter did WorkItem persistence and execution creation itself.
**Fix:**
- [x] `IssueTrackerAdapter` contract (`src/integrations/types.ts`): `fetchEligibleItems(config) → { repositoryId, items: NormalizedWorkItem[] }` and `comment(config, externalId, text)`.
- [x] Registry (`src/integrations/trackerRegistry.ts`) keyed by `IntegrationType` and `ExternalSystem`; Trello is the only registered adapter.
- [x] Trello adapter reduced to Trello API calls plus a pure `toWorkItems()` mapper; revision-hash formula unchanged (pinned by test) so existing cards keep their execution idempotency keys.
- [x] New `src/services/ingestionService.ts`: tracker-neutral WorkItem upsert + `createExecution` (`syncIntegrationConnection`) and `commentOnWorkItem`.
- [x] `trelloPollingService.ts` → `integrationPollingService.ts`, polling every registered tracker type. `INTEGRATION_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` added; `TRELLO_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` still honoured.
- [x] `POST /api/integrations/:id/sync` dispatches by connection type; non-tracker types (e.g. `GITHUB`) now return 400 instead of being sent to the Trello API.
- [x] Worker `notifyTrello` → `notifyTracker` (comments on the source ticket in whichever tracker it came from).
- [x] Tests: `tests/trackerAdapters.test.js` (pinned Trello hash, label filtering, mapping, registry dispatch, plug-in registration).

**Adding another tracker later** (deliberately not done; no Jira support exists):
1. Add the value to `IntegrationType` in `prisma/schema.prisma` + migration (`ExternalSystem` may already have it), and allow it in the `POST /integrations` route schema.
2. Implement `IssueTrackerAdapter` in `src/integrations/<tracker>Adapter.ts` with a stable `revisionHash`.
3. Register it in `trackerRegistry.ts`.

### - [ ] A2 — Source control is GitHub-only
**Status:** TODO (only when a second provider is needed) · **Fix ref:** —
**Where:** `src/integrations/githubApp.ts`, `src/services/workspaceService.ts` (`github.com` clone URLs), `src/services/executionWorker.ts` (`publish`); `Repository.provider` exists but is unused.
**Fix:**
- [ ] `ScmProvider` interface (`getBaseSha`, clone/auth, `findOpenPullRequest`, `createDraftPullRequest`) selected by `Repository.provider`.

## Suggested next order

1. **Verify:** F3 (one real end-to-end run); merge `chore/repo-hygiene`.
2. **Quick wins:** M5, M4, L2.
3. **Tests:** X4, rest of X5.
4. **Robustness:** M2, M3 (remaining), M6, M7, M8, F1, F2, M10–M12.
5. **Cleanup:** remaining Low items, X1–X3, F4.
